JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and cookie-based authentication are two different approaches to managing user authentication and sessions in web applications. They have distinct characteristics and use cases, and the choice between them depends on your application's requirements. Here's a comparison of the two:

## **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**

1. **Stateless**: JWTs are typically stateless, meaning that all the necessary information to verify a user's identity and permissions is contained within the token itself. This means you don't need to store session data on the server.

2. **Client-Side Storage**: JWTs are stored on the client-side, often in local storage or cookies. The server does not keep track of individual sessions.

3. **Scalability**: Because JWTs are stateless, they are easier to scale horizontally. You can validate a JWT without relying on server-side session storage.

4. **Flexibility**: JWTs can store arbitrary data in the form of claims, making them versatile for carrying information about a user, such as roles, permissions, and more.

5. **Cross-Origin**: JWTs can be used for cross-origin authentication, making them suitable for single sign-on (SSO) scenarios.

6. **Complexity**: Implementing JWT-based authentication may require more effort, especially when handling token issuance, validation, and token revocation.

## **Cookie/Session-Based Authentication:**

1. **Stateful**: Cookie-based authentication relies on server-side session storage to maintain user sessions. Each user is assigned a unique session ID (UUID usually), which is stored in a cookie on the client side and mapped to session data on the server.

2. **Server-Side Storage**: Session data is stored on the server, which can be a database, an in-memory store, or a distributed cache, depending on your application's requirements.

3. **Scalability**: Scaling cookie-based authentication can be more challenging because you need to manage session data across multiple servers. Load balancing strategies like sticky sessions may be necessary.

4. **Security**: Cookies are more secure by default because they cannot be accessed by JavaScript (when marked as HttpOnly) and are sent securely over HTTPS connections.

5. **Revocation**: Revoking a user's session is typically easier with cookie-based authentication because you can invalidate the session server-side.

6. **Cross-Origin**: Cookie-based authentication can be more challenging for cross-origin authentication and SSO because it relies on cookies that are bound to a specific domain.

## **Use Case Considerations:**

* JWT: JWTs are often preferred for stateless, API-centric applications or when dealing with multiple services and microservices. They are also suitable for mobile and single-page applications (SPAs).

* Cookie-Based Authentication: Traditional web applications with a server-rendered UI often use cookie-based authentication. It's a simpler choice for handling user sessions, especially when dealing with complex authorization logic or when cross-origin concerns are not a primary consideration.

In practice, some applications may use a combination of both approaches, where JWTs are used for API authentication, and cookie-based authentication is used for the web UI. The choice should be based on your specific requirements and security considerations.


### Notes:
* JWT is a form of Token authentication
* Cookies-based authentication in asp.net core is not as simple as descrbied above, it does stores user claims and a lot of information also and return it signed/encrypted to the user and when the server recieves a request it extracts the encrypted value and decrypt it and that way we achieve higher security and flexibility and of course we are approaching a more stateless authentication implementation 
* It's optional in asp.net core to configure state management by the server side
